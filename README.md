# JB-Stock-Watch
This is a small simple program created to display a widget from widgets.tc200.com that you can create a list of stocks you want to watch. The one in the code is mine but if you ever went to that page you can create your own then plug it in. If you go to the site and update your widgets your stock program will update because all it is doing is pulling the feed from the widget. Very short and simple code. Highlighted areas would be areas you would want to change for your project.  Not included in this but I have an .ico file in the same folder that is pulling the dollar image on the app. You might also need to play with the windows size if you had your own list.
